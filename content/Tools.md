# The Tools 
## Markdown 
This Knowledgebase is mainly written in Markdown files. This makes them portable as they are plaintext and can be carried forward even if the tools to render and present them in this website no longer work. 

## Obsidian 
Obsidian is a Markdown Editor that allows for simple and easy linking between markdown documents. With built in support for meta data organizing information has never been easier.  
## Quartz 
Quartz is a utility written in NodeJs that manages the rendering of our obsidian vault to an easy to navigate web page. 

## Github 
Github is the glue that holds all this together. Github not only hosts all the markdown files for this knowledgebase it also hosts and automatically updates this page when a new change is made to the repository. You can check out our [Repository](https://github.com/FRC-Team-237/knowledge-base). All the documents are in the `content` folder. if you'd like to set this up for your own robotics team you can follow the instructions on the [[How To]].
