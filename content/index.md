# Welcome
Hello and welcome to the Watertown FIRST Robotics Team Knowledge base. One of the most difficult things about running a FIRST Robotics team is maintaining and transferring knowledge. Year after year As Students Graduate and mentors schedules change knowledge gets lost and erodes. 

This is part of the nature of a FRC team. We exist to educate Students. Having an easily searchable and maintainable knowledge repository will ensure our program exists long into the future. 
# The Goals 
## To collect and retain knowledge
 The goal of this knowledge base to collect and retain as much information as possible so that the team can operate smoothly year to year. Additionally we maintain this repository mostly in plain text so that it remains portable and can move with the team should the need arise. 
## To Educate 
This knowledgebase will serve to help further that goal by providing an easily searchable resource for the team to use. From [[Programing]], to [[Mechanical]], to [[Operations]] this will be a one stop shop for Students and mentors alike to refer to.
